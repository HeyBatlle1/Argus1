# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Email: [TBD - set up security email]

We take security seriously. That's literally why this project exists.

## What to Report

- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Sandbox escapes
- Memory safety issues
- Any way to access secrets without proper authentication

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity, but we move fast

## Recognition

Security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities will be credited in our security advisories (unless they prefer anonymity).

We don't have a bug bounty program yet, but we have gratitude and respect.
